# EmailChecker
Checking Email for possible Phishing Email
You only need to provide FREE API keys in order for this code to work, I included the link of the APIs in the comment code next to the
constants. 
Code can scan for the sender's email address as well as for grammar in the text of the email and last but not least 
if email contains any link just paste it.
Depending on the final score you will be provided with the message if the Email is suspecious or not.
